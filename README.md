# Rainy Day
This simulation was created in a game jam in september 2022.
Rainy Day is a weather simulation made with python/pygame. The simulation provides day and night, seasons and different weather conditions, e.g. rain, snow, thunderstorm etc.

It is built on a grid where each cell can contain an item such as water, fire, dirt, stone, etc. If you want, you can choose a material and draw with it. Each material has its own properties and behaves differently.
